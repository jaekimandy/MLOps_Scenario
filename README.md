# Task 4: MLOps Scenario
• Consider a machine learning model that needs to be trained and deployed in a production environment.  
• Describe the steps you would take to automate the model training and deployment process.  
• Explain how you would version control the model artifacts and track the model's lineage.  
• Discuss the challenges and best practices for monitoring and managing the deployed model in production.
